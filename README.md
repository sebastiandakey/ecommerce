# A web app for conducting e-commerce
A simple ecommerce platform that allows user to shop for products, add to cart, update product quantities in carts.

The program implements classes to make the codebase modular and maintainable

It uses MYSQL as the database to store products, customer and other relevant business information. MYSQL is the best choice because it is relational hence enforces integrity.

It uses PHP for the backend. I used PHP becuase I wanted to learn the language.
